# About this project:
Our goal is to develop a centralized platform that allows the creation of digital pages for groups of students from UNAL, and providing an agile way of accessing the information they provide. With this platform, students will have a closer relationship with the university community beyond the existing academic resources, promoting a greater sense of unity and commitment among students.
